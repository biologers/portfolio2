        <p>My name is Danazie Jeffries, im 20 years old and I am a student at waketech. I moved to Raleigh when I was around 6 years old and have been in North Carolina since. Growing up i've always had a passion for everything technology related. From gameboys, ipods, and leap pads I loved it all. My recent desire to be in the IT field came from my love of computers. Ever since I built my own computer i've been more invested in the technology lore. Currently studying in networking I plan to graduate in the next two-ish years. Though I am someone who is very intrested in Arizona state university, so I might find myself doing more time in school down the road. Whenever I do finish school though im looking to possibly work a goverment job possibly in maryland.</p>
